# General Guidelines
 

In this graded assignment, you will be asked questions based on the concepts that you’ve learnt in Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing. This is a subjective assignment and hence, you are required to write the answers and submit them in a PDF file. For writing normal text, you can use MS Word — or any other similar software which can convert word files to the .pdf format. For writing equations, drawing figures, etc. you can do so on a blank sheet of paper, photograph the images and upload them in the same word document.

 

Please limit your answers to 200-300 words per question. While calculating values, ensure you write all the necessary steps and formulae. Also, use the correct terminology to present the solution.

 

The final submission will be in one PDF file. A sample PDF file that illustrates the submission format is given below. You are advised to go through it at least once — to gain further understanding of the solution methodology that you are expected to follow.
